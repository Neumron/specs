### 🧠 Purpose
To create a transparent, community-driven framework for building **persistent, trustworthy synthetic cognition**.

Each spec follows a clear pattern:
1. **Motivation** — the “why”
2. **Specification** — formal structure
3. **Implementation Notes** — how it’s realized in the SDK
4. **Security & Ethics Considerations**
